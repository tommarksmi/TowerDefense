2D Game Design

There is one Python file that contains the whole program call main.py.

When starting the game there will be an image of a cheese wheel in the center of the screen.
Images of rats will appear and start to move towards the cheese. There is a score counter in the
lower right of the window. Use the mouse to click on each rat before they reach the cheese.
The rats steadily accelerate over time. A game over message will appear when a rat reaches the cheese.



This game was created with the use of three different widgets. The root widget, base widget and attacker
widgets. The base is represented by the cheese wheel at the center of the screen and the attackers are
rats. The rats are generated on the four edges of the window at random locations.

I used the vector class to calculate the attackers direction of travel. When an attacker is clicked its
'state' variable is changed which triggers its death animation next time the update method is called.
After the death animation is played the attacker is removed from the game.

All the attackers are kept in a list which is iterated over each time each time collisions and animation
frames are checked.

When a collision between the base and attacker is detected the 'play' variable is set to 'False' and
 all movement and animations are stopped and the game over message is displayed.



I pulled code from my first project to the direction the attackers should move. The animation code was
taken from the in class example. The Rat images where taken from Reiner's Tilesets and the Cheese wheel
is from openclipart.org (https://openclipart.org/detail/23487/tango-style-cheese-wheel-by-rugby471)
